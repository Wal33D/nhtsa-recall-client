# Roadmap

1. Polish Python client with richer models (e.g., parsed dates, helper filters).
2. Publish Java client to Maven Central and back the Android module with the published artifact.
3. Add caching and retry logic shared across languages.
4. Expand test coverage with recorded API fixtures and compatibility tests.
5. Provide CLI/demo apps mirroring the VIN decoder tooling.
